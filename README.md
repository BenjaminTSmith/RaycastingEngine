# RaycastingEngine
This is a simple 2.5D game engine I created that uses similar raycasting techniques to that of games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.
Currently, there is only a brick (sorta) room you can walk around in. The way to edit the map is to change the std::array titled "mapArray". An octothorpe
signifies a wall while a period is an empty space. I will be adding more in the future, with the goal of creating a completely ray-casted horror game
from scratch and a fully usable engine that can be used to create any ray-casted game.
